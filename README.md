## Diff Checker

Couldn't find any good diff tools online (for free ahem [diffchecker.com](https://www.diffchecker.com/text-compare/)), so i built one.

## Ideas

- `collapse lines`
- highlighting the words that are different. (not just the entire line.)
- syntax-highlighting for various languages later.

current code built mostly with [bolt.new](https://bolt.new).
